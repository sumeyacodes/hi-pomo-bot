## The problem this project solves

I created HiPomo to help streamline study group sessions for my cohort on our Discord server.

A few of us wanted to benefit from community learning through study or body doubling sessions. Initially, we manually set Pomodoro timers and shared screens, which was too inefficient.

The HiPomo bot helped to simplifiy and automate this process by providing an inbuilt timer on the server for everyone to use. When activated, it starts with a 25-minute focus session that automatically mutes all voice channel members, followed by either a long or short break (depending on selection).
